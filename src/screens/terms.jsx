                        that this license includes the right for us to make such User Content available to other users of the

                        You represent and warrant that: (i) the User Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it
                        and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of the User Content on

                        We ask that you respect our on-line community and other users when posting User Content and using

                        similar information without their permission.
                        submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing,
                        hateful, racially, or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal
                        offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate.

                    <h2>Rights and Terms for Apps</h2>
                    <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you have the right to download and install a copy of any
                        App(s) to your mobile device, and to access and use the Services, for your own personal use. With
                        respect to each App you download, you may not: (i) copy, modify or distribute the App for any purpose;
                        (ii) transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise distribute the App or the Services to any third
                        party; (iii) decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the App or the
                        Services; (iv) make the functionality of the App or the Services available to multiple users through any
                        means; or (v) use the Services in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner
                        inconsistent with these Terms.
                        The following terms apply to any App accessed through or downloaded from any app store or
                        distribution platform (like the Apple App Store or Google Play) where the App is made available (each, an
                        “App Provider”). You acknowledge and agree that:
                        These Terms are concluded between you and CHAT Z Y R , and not with the App Provider, and that CHAT
                        Z Y R (not the App Provider), is solely responsible for the App.
                        The App Provider has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the
                        App.
                        In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify the App
                        Provider, and the App Provider will refund the purchase price for the App to you (if applicable) and to the
                        maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App Provider will have no other warranty obligation
                        whatsoever with respect to the App. Any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses
                        attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of CHAT Z Y R .
                        The App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party
                        relating to the App or your possession and use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product
                        liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory
                        requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
                        In the event of any third party claim that the App or your possession and use of that App infringes that
                        third party’s intellectual property rights, CHAT Z Y R will be solely responsible for the investigation,
                        defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent
                        required by these Terms.
                        The App Provider, and its subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your
                        license of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, the App
                        Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as
                        related to your license of the App against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
                        You must also comply with all applicable third-party terms of service when using the App.

                        Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your
